ðŸ‘‹ U.S. Army veteran and IT pro passionate about retro games, sci-fi, and building secure, efficient systems. Iâ€™m sharpening skills in Python, SQL, SharePoint, and Microsoft 365, driven by Lowellâ€™s vibrant community. Open to exciting collabs in IT support and software development!

## About Me
IT professional with a BS in Information Technology (UMass Lowell, 2010) and near-complete MS in Computer Science (Merrimack College, expected Dec 2025). I design automated, secure solutions for Windows/Linux environments, with a focus on user support and system reliability. My military background fuels my attention to detail and problem-solving. Skilled in:
- **Support & Platforms**: SharePoint Online, Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, OneDrive, Forms), queue-based ticketing systems.
- **Server Management**: RHEL 9, Windows Server, virtualization (VMware ESXi, Proxmox, KVM/QEMU).
- **Programming & Automation**: Python, SQL, PowerShell (learning), Docker, Git, cron scripting.
- **Database & Security**: MariaDB/MySQL, API integration, Cloudflare tunneling, firewalld/SELinux.

Fun fact: My sonâ€™s my biggest inspirationâ€”couldnâ€™t ask for a better wingman!

## Key Projects
- **SharePoint Online Support Simulation** (2025): Built a test SharePoint Online environment to troubleshoot user access, permissions, and list integration issues, simulating Tier 1 support. Documented resolutions in a mock ticketing system, boosting efficiency by 25%.
- **Coinbase BTC Trading Bot** ([github.com/raspberryl13/coinbase_btc_bot](https://github.com/raspberryl13/coinbase_btc_bot)): Python-based bot for Coinbase Advanced Trade, automating buy/sell orders with Docker and secure API integration, cutting oversight by 90%.
- **RHEL 9 Server Administration** (2025): Deployed RHEL 9 on Proxmox/ESXi, managing MariaDB databases and automating backups with cron, achieving 99.9% uptime for development environments.
- **SQL Baseball Statistics Database** (2025): Designed an SQL database for a baseball league, optimizing tables and queries to improve retrieval efficiency by 30%.
- **Platformer Game** (In Progress): Early-stage 2D game in Pixel Game Maker MV, applying systems design for creative IT solutions, inspired by Lowellâ€™s gaming community.

## Scripts
- **Samba Share Setup**: Automates SMB shares for Debian/Ubuntu.
- **Fib-ception**: Recursion, but probably the worst way. Python writes C++ code and compiles it, that code does the calculation, etc.
- **Hello COBOL**: Automates GnuCOBOL, with procedural and OOP versions.
- **Windows Software Installer GUI**: Python GUI app automating Windows software installs via Chocolatey and Tkinter, compiled as a standalone `.exe`.
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/install-gui/install_gui.py

## Community & Education
- **Education**:
  - MS, Computer Science (Expected Dec 2025, GPA: 3.8) â€“ Merrimack College
  - BS, Information Technology (2010, GPA: 3.95) â€“ UMass Lowell
- **Certifications**: Google IT Support (2025), Google IT Automation with Python (2025), COBOL Programming with VSCode (2025).
- **Community**: Passionate about leveraging tech to uplift Lowellâ€™s diverse Irish, Khmer, and Cantonese communities.
